## ABOUT ME:

I am a **Data Analytics and Database Specialist** at [**Covenant House Toronto**](https://covenanthousetoronto.ca/), bringing my data analysis skills to support meaningful work in the nonprofit sector. Previously, as a **Computer Science** student at [**TMU - Toronto Metropolitan University**](https://www.torontomu.ca/) with a focus on data mining and processing, I have developed a strong foundation in machine learning and data analysis.

During my time at [**IAMLAB - Image Analysis in Medicine Lab**](https://www.torontomu.ca/akhademi/) under the guidance of [**Dr. April Khademi**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aprilkhademi/), I had the opportunity to delve into the fascinating field of digital pathology. My work primarily focused on exploring the intricacies of tumor detection, where I applied advanced machine learning techniques to analyze medical imaging data. This experience not only honed my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of the critical role that data plays in healthcare and disease diagnosis.

I am passionate about leveraging technology to make a positive impact on society, and I am eager to continue my journey in the field of data science. With my strong academic background, hands-on experience, and enthusiasm for learning, I am confident in my ability to contribute to innovative projects and tackle the challenges of tomorrow's data-driven world.
