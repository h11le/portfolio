## About me:

As a **Computer Science** student at **Toronto Metropolitan University** - TMU with a focus on data mining and processing, I have developed a strong foundation in machine learning and data analysis. My experience includes building machine learning models using Python and its libraries, where I have tackled various real-world problems and gained valuable insights into predictive modeling and data-driven decision-making.

During my time at [**IAMLAB**](https://www.torontomu.ca/akhademi/) - **Image Analysis in Medicine Lab** under the guidance of [**Dr. April Khademi**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aprilkhademi/), I had the opportunity to delve into the fascinating field of digital pathology. My work primarily focused on exploring the intricacies of tumor detection, where I applied advanced machine learning techniques to analyze medical imaging data. This experience not only honed my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of the critical role that data plays in healthcare and disease diagnosis.

I am passionate about leveraging technology to make a positive impact on society, and I am eager to continue my journey in the field of data science and machine learning. With my strong academic background, hands-on experience, and enthusiasm for learning, I am confident in my ability to contribute to innovative projects and tackle the challenges of tomorrow's data-driven world.

I am actively seeking full-time opportunities in the field of data science or related areas. If you have any job openings or would like to discuss potential opportunities, please feel free to [contact me](mailto:h11le@torontomu.ca).
